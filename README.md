# Checking out Selenium!

### Motivation
My goal with this project was to learn the basics of Selenium to programmatically control a webbrowser (in my case, Google Chrome using chromedriver).

I had two potential usecases in mind:
- Automating extraction of transaction data from my bank account and credit card websites
- Automating data pull for a project at work

### Project Description
A friend found this [Danish IQ test](http://mensa.dk/iqtest/index.html) and shared it with our Discord server.

I noticed that the test didn't randomize the questions - it was always the same questions every time!
I wrote this script to learn Selenium basics and also to see if I could figure out the answers to every question (some of the IQ test questions are very abstract, and I was curious to see the 'correct' answers.)
